# Welcome to the Black Box Software Testing course site repository

This repository contains the resources and materials from the Black Box Software Testing course, originally created by Kaner, Fiedler & Associates.

The course covered various topics in software testing, including test design techniques, test management, and the role of the tester in the software development process. It was a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn more about software testing and improve their skills in this area.

Thanks to this repository, you will be able to continue to access and use these resources, even though the course is no longer actively being taught. We hope that you find the materials in this repository to be helpful and informative.
