Bug Advocacy: Effective Bug Investigation and Reporting
-------------------------------------------------------

### Overview

Bug reports are not just neutral technical reports. They are persuasive documents. The key goal of the bug report author is to provide high-quality information, well written, to help stakeholders make wise decisions about which bugs to fix. Key aspects of the content of this course include:

-   Defining key concepts (such as software error, quality, and the bug processing workflow)
-   The scope of bug reporting (what to report as bugs, and what information to include)
-   Bug reporting as persuasive writing
-   Bug investigation to discover harsher failures and simpler replication conditions
-   Excuses and reasons for not fixing bugs
-   Making bugs reproducible
-   Lessons from the psychology of decision-making: bug-handling as a multiple-decision process dominated by heuristics and biases
-   Style and structure of well-written bug reports

### Videos

#### Lecture 1: Basic Concepts

Explore the diversity of opinions about "quality" and "bugs." The lecture presents the multi-dimensional view of quality used throughout the BBST courses.

-   [Lecture 1 (35 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220323034400/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/bugadvocacy/BugAdvocacy2008A.wmv) (WMV)

#### Lecture 2: Effective Advocacy: Making People Want to Fix the Bug

How to develop reports that clearly communicate bugs in their harshest honest light so that decision-makers can operate with insight into the consequences of each bug.

-   [Lecture 2 (27 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220323034400/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/bugadvocacy/BugAdvocacy2008B.wmv) (WMV)

#### Lecture 3: Anticipating and Dealing with Objections: Irreproducible Bugs

Strategies for exploring non-reproducible bugs to make them reproducible or at least to provide information to help troubleshooting efforts.

-   [Lecture 3 (17 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220323034400/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/bugadvocacy/BugAdvocacy2008C.wmv) (WMV)

#### Lecture 4: Anticipating and Dealing with Objections: The Content, Clarity, and Credibility of the Report

How testers can make their reports useful and more credible for better decision-making by others working in the development effort.

-   [Lecture 4 (12 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220323034400/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/bugadvocacy/BugAdvocacy2008D.wmv) (WMV)

#### Lecture 5: Credibility and Influence

In addition to the quality of bug reports, a tester's actions can influence how much credibility and influence they have on a project. This lecture draws on research on bias and signal detection theory to explore some of the things that enhance or diminish a tester's credibility.
