BBST Instructors Course
-----------------------

### Overview

### Becoming a BBST Instructor

Instructors in the BBST project are software testing professionals. To qualify as a course instructor, prospective candidates must:

-   successfully complete the course they wish to teach
-   complete an instructor training course
-   work as an assistant instructor during several teachings of the same course -- with an increasing level of responsibility each time
-   be recommended as a qualified lead instructor by other lead instructors
-   be a member of the [Association for Software Testing](https://web.archive.org/web/20211024033132/http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/) and therefore bound by the [ACM Code of Ethics](https://web.archive.org/web/20211024033132/http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/about/membership/code-of-ethics/)

### Instructor Training Course

The Instructor Training Course is currently offered online and face-to-face. Both formats are available from the [Association for Software Testing](https://web.archive.org/web/20211024033132/http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/). Scheduling information for the online course is available at the Training link on the AST web site. The face-to-face version is offered annually at the AST annual conference.

#### Lecture 1: BBST Teaching Philosophy and Models

The BBST online courses were developed in conjunction with the Association for Software Testing. In the time we taught these courses, we developed an apprenticeship model to help professional software testers become effective online instructors. In this lecture, we show how that model works and provide a broad overview of the BBST project and how it has evolved over the years. We also explain a bit about the underlying software testing philosophy that guides our approach to the field, and introduce you to some of the learning theories and perspectives that guided the development of the BBST courses. Finally, Fiedler explains why the various components are included in the BBST courses and how they all fit together.
