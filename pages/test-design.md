Test Design: A Survey of Black Box Software Testing Techniques
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview

This course is a survey of test techniques. We look at a few techniques more closely than the rest but we don't expect this course to make you a skilled practitioner of any technique.

-   Gain familiarity with a variety of test techniques.
-   Learn structures for comparing objectives and strengths of different test techniques.
-   Use the Heuristic Test Strategy Model for test planning and design.
-   Use concept mapping tools for test planning.

The course takes a fast skim of several dozen techniques, and looks at a few in detail.

The current slide set comes in the course sequence after sections on:

-   Function testing
-   Domain testing (and with it, a first look at risk-based testing)
-   Scenario testing

We then skim a group of 10 different techniques, noticing their different objectives, strengths and blind spots.

#### Lecture 1: Function Testing, Tours, & A Taxonomy of Techniques

This lecture provides a structure for organizing your thinking about the many test techniques, and a focus on testing tours and on function testing. (Why together? The most common tour is an excellent foundation for function testing.)
