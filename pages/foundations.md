Foundations of Software Testing
-------------------------------

### Overview

This first course is a basic introduction to black box testing. It presents basic terminology and considers:

-   the mission of testing
-   the oracle problem
-   the measurement problem
-   the impossibility of complete testing

### Videos

#### Lecture 1: Overview & Basic Definitions

This provides an overview of the online Black Box Software Testing courses and introduces some definitions commonly used in the testing field.

-   [Lecture 1a (10 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture1aFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)-   [Lecture 1b (10 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture1bFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)-   [Lecture 1c (9 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture1cFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)

#### Lecture 2: Strategy

This considers why testers test, what they are trying to learn, and how they can organize their work to achieve their mission.

-   [Lecture 2a (9 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture2aFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)-   [Lecture 2b (9 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture2bFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)

#### Lecture 3: Oracles

This presents software oracles as heuristics that help testers make a judgment whether or not software passes the tests that are run.

-   [Lecture 3a (7 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture3aFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)-   [Lecture 3b (10 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture3bFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)-   [Lecture 3c (7 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture3cFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)

#### Lecture 4: Programming Fundamentals & Coverage

This presents information about basic data handling and storage to help testers think about the multi-dimensional problem of test coverage in more sophisticated ways.

-   [Lecture 4a (10 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture4aFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)-   [Lecture 4b (9 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture4bFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)-   [Lecture 4c (9 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture4cFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)-   [Lecture 4d (4 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture4dFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)

#### Lecture 5: The Impossibility of Complete Testing

This explores the complexity of determining when testing is finished and how the goal of complete testing is unattainable.

-   [Lecture 5a (9 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture5aFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)-   [Lecture 5b (10 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture5bFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)-   [Lecture 5c (10 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture5cFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)

#### Lecture 6: Introduction to Measurement

This addresses the challenges of measurement in software testing.

-   [Lecture 6a (9 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture6aFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)-   [Lecture 6b (9 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture6bFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)-   [Lecture 6c (7 mins)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220205053655/http://testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Lecture6cFoundations2010.mp4) (MP4)
