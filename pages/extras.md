Additional Topics and Resources
-------------------------------

### Overview

Other sections of this site tie to topics that we do (or plan to) cover in the program for the Certificate in Software Testing and the program for the Certificate in Advanced Testing Design.

Here we share additional slides and videos we've use in several of our courses or in conference talks.
